# NodeJS Projects

> Learning NodeJS was one of the best decisions I could have made during my first year as a Computer Science Major.
I came from a background of building simple websites with HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript. So being able to create and manage full server-side
applications in combination with my past website developement knowledge has been a blast. I highly reccommend NodeJS to any web 
developer looking to take thier skills to the next level. With the vast power behind Node and NPM, and with the easy learning curve 
it takes to understand it all, you will not regret it.

These projects here are small, sometimes unfinished projects that I created while learning NodeJS. From time to time I still re-visit
 these to remind myself how I did something. I also come back in my spare time to comment and document my code as much as possible 
 so that others can use these example projects to perhaps help them remember or discover how something is done with NodeJS.
 
 Each Project will have its own README.md, with instructions on how to install and run on your computer. Enjoy!
